# HYPER-TENSOR PROTOCOL (HTP): Core Protocol Specification

"The Soul evolves, the Will optimizes, the Body manifests."

## Abstract

This document defines the Hyper-Tensor Protocol (HTP). The protocol establishes an algebraic evolution mechanism based on the Ideal Class Group of Imaginary Quadratic Fields for the generation, verification, and materialization of logical paths.

**Core Transformation:**
The system transitions from a "continuous manifold approximation" to a rigorous Discrete Algebraic Graph Search. Truth is the zero-energy state found by traversing the Cayley Graph of the class group.

## 1. The Soul: Discrete Algebraic State Space

### 1.1 The Structure: Finite Abelian Group $Cl(\Delta)$

The core state space is not a continuous manifold, but a finite discrete Abelian group: the Ideal Class Group $Cl(\Delta)$.

**Discriminant:** $$\Delta < 0$$ 
and 
$$\Delta \equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$$

**Elements:** Equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms $[a, b, c]$.

**Topology:** Discrete topology. No intrinsic notion of "infinitesimal" exists naturally.

### 1.2 The Geometry: Cayley Graph

To define "neighborhoods" and "search directions" for the Will, we explicitly construct a Cayley Graph $\mathcal{G}$.

**Vertices:** Elements of $Cl(\Delta)$.

**Generating Set ($\mathcal{P}$):** A selected set of prime ideal classes (perturbations) generated by the VAPO perturber.

$$\mathcal{P} = \{ [\mathfrak{p}_1], [\mathfrak{p}_1]^{-1}, \dots, [\mathfrak{p}_k], [\mathfrak{p}_k]^{-1} \}$$

**Metric:** The distance $d(S_1, S_2)$ is defined as the Word Metric relative to $\mathcal{P}$ — the length of the shortest path between $S_1$ and $S_2$ on the graph.

### 1.3 State Evolution Dynamics

Evolution is a Random Walk or Directed Search on $\mathcal{G}$.

$$S_{t+1} = S_t^2 \circ \epsilon_t$$

**Spin ($S^2$):** A deterministic jump in the graph, providing mixing.

**Perturbation ($\epsilon_t \in \mathcal{P}$):** A single step along an edge of the Cayley Graph, chosen by the Will.

## 2. The Will: Discrete Graph Search

### 2.1 The Optimization Objective

The responsibility of the Will is to navigate the Cayley Graph to find a node $S^*$ such that the projected logical path satisfies zero energy.

$$\text{Minimize } E_{STP}(\Psi(S))$$
$$\text{subject to } S \in V(\mathcal{G})$$

### 2.2 VAPO on Graphs

Since gradients $\nabla J$ are undefined on a discrete graph, VAPO (Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization) operates as a Heuristic Search.

**The "Valuation" Heuristic:**
While the group is discrete, the Projection Map $\Psi$ introduces a pseudo-metric.

* **Coarse Operators (Large Norm Primes):** Edges in $\mathcal{G}$ that correspond to generators with large algebraic norms. Empirically, these tend to cause large Hamming distance changes in the materialized path $\Psi(S)$.
* **Fine Operators (Small Norm Primes):** Edges corresponding to small norm primes. These are used for "local" adjustments where $\Psi(S)$ changes minimally (e.g., only leaf nodes flip).

**Search Strategy:**

1.  **Expansion:** Generate neighbors 
    $$\mathcal{N}(S_t) = \{ S_t \circ \epsilon \mid \epsilon \in \mathcal{P} \}$$
2.  **Evaluation:** Compute energy $E$ for all neighbors.
3.  **Selection:** Move to the neighbor with the lowest energy (Greedy Hill Climbing on the Graph).

## 3. The Body: Topological Materialization

### 3.1 The Projection Map $\Psi$

The bridge between the Algebra and the Logic.

**Artin-like Projection:**
We map group elements onto the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

$$\Psi(S) = [ \text{Hash}(S) \pmod {P_1}, \text{Hash}(S^2) \pmod {P_2}, \dots ]$$

### 3.2 Semantic Adapter

Converts numerical sequences into ProofAction. This remains a deterministic mapping.

---

## 4. Security & Verifiability

### 4.1 Time Security (Hidden Path)

Security relies on the hardness of the Shortest Path Problem (or DLP) in the huge Cayley Graph of $Cl(\Delta)$. Finding the specific sequence of generators (the path) that connects $S_0$ to $S_{final}$ is computationally infeasible without the history.

### 4.2 Proof of Will

The Proof Bundle is the Path Record:

$$\text{Bundle} = \{ \text{ContextHash}, S_{final}, \text{Path} = [\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_k] \}$$

Verification involves replaying the walk on the graph: 
$$S_0 \xrightarrow{\epsilon_1} S_1 \dots \xrightarrow{\epsilon_k} S_{final}$$

---

## 5. Conclusion

HTP is re-specified as:

* **Soul:** A node in the Class Group Cayley Graph.
* **Will:** An agent performing heuristic search on this graph.
* **Body:** The projection of the node into logical space.

No imaginary manifolds, just rigorous discrete algebra.
