# HYPER-TENSOR PROTOCOL (HTP): Core Protocol Specification

"The Soul evolves, the Will optimizes, the Body manifests."

## Abstract

This document defines the Hyper-Tensor Protocol (HTP). The protocol establishes an algebraic evolution mechanism based on the Ideal Class Group of Imaginary Quadratic Fields for the generation, verification, and materialization of logical paths.

**Core Transformation:**
The system transitions from a "continuous manifold approximation" to a rigorous Discrete Algebraic Graph Search. Truth is the zero-energy state found by traversing the Cayley Graph of the class group.

## 1. The Soul: Discrete Algebraic State Space

### 1.1 The Structure: Finite Abelian Group $Cl(\Delta)$

The core state space is not a continuous manifold, but a finite discrete Abelian group: the Ideal Class Group $Cl(\Delta)$.

**Discriminant:**

$$\Delta < 0$$

and

$$\Delta \equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$$

**Elements:** Equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms $[a, b, c]$.

**Topology:** Discrete topology. No intrinsic notion of "infinitesimal" exists naturally.

### 1.2 The Geometry: Cayley Graph

To define "neighborhoods" and "search directions" for the Will, we explicitly construct a Cayley Graph $\mathcal{G}$.

**Vertices:** Elements of $Cl(\Delta)$.

**Generating Set ($\mathcal{P}$):** A selected set of prime ideal classes (perturbations) generated by the VAPO perturber.

$$\mathcal{P} = \{ [\mathfrak{p}_1], [\mathfrak{p}_1]^{-1}, \dots, [\mathfrak{p}_k], [\mathfrak{p}_k]^{-1} \}$$

**Metric:** The distance $d(S_1, S_2)$ is defined as the Word Metric relative to $\mathcal{P}$ — the length of the shortest path between $S_1$ and $S_2$ on the graph.

### 1.3 State Evolution Dynamics (Decoupled)

To preserve the local metric structure required for optimization (Lipschitz continuity), we explicitly decouple the Search Dynamics from the Time Dynamics.

#### 1. Search Dynamics (The Will's Walk)

The Will operates on the static Cayley Graph. It moves from neighbor to neighbor to find the optimal seed.

$$S_{k+1} = S_k \circ \epsilon_k$$

$S_k$: The current candidate seed at search step $k$.

$\epsilon_k \in \mathcal{P}$: A perturbation (generator) chosen by the VAPO optimizer.

#### 2. Time Dynamics (The Observation)

Once a candidate seed $S$ is selected (or evaluated), it is "unfolded" in time to generate the logical path. This is the VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) aspect.

$$O_0 = S$$

$$O_{t+1} = O_t^2$$

The logical path is derived from the orbit $O_0, O_1, \dots, O_T$.

## 2. The Will: Discrete Graph Search

### 2.1 The Optimization Objective

The responsibility of the Will is to navigate the Cayley Graph to find a node $S^*$ such that the projected logical path satisfies zero energy.

$$\text{Minimize } E_{STP}(\Psi(S))$$

$$\text{subject to } S \in V(\mathcal{G})$$

### 2.2 VAPO on Graphs

Since gradients $\nabla J$ are undefined on a discrete graph, VAPO (Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization) operates as a Heuristic Search.

**The "Valuation" Heuristic:**
The efficacy of VAPO relies strictly on the Lipschitz continuity of the Projection Map $\Psi$. Small steps in the graph must result in bounded changes in the logical output.

* **Coarse Operators (Large Norm Primes):** Edges in $\mathcal{G}$ that correspond to generators with large algebraic norms. These tend to cause larger shifts in the modulo projection.
* **Fine Operators (Small Norm Primes):** Edges corresponding to small norm primes. These act as "local" adjustments.

**Search Strategy:**

* **Expansion:** Generate neighbors
$$\mathcal{N}(S_t) = \{ S_t \circ \epsilon \mid \epsilon \in \mathcal{P} \}$$
* **Evaluation:** Compute energy $E$ for all neighbors.
* **Selection:** Move to the neighbor with the lowest energy (Greedy Hill Climbing on the Graph).

## 3. The Body: Topological Materialization

### 3.1 The Projection Map $\Psi$ (Corrected)

The bridge between the Algebra and the Logic must preserve local structure to allow optimization. We employ Linear Congruence Projection (LCP) rather than cryptographic hashing.

**Linear Congruence Projection:**
We map the reduced form coefficients $(a, b)$ of the ideal class $S$ onto the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

For the $k$-th step in the logical sequence generated from state $S$:

$$\Psi_k(S) = (a(S) + k \cdot b(S)) \pmod {P}$$

Where:
* $a(S), b(S)$ are the coefficients of the reduced binary quadratic form representing $S$.
* $P$ is the projection modulus (dimension of the logical action space).
* $k$ is the sequence index, introducing linear variation derived from the state itself.

**Why LCP?**
Unlike a Hash function, LCP is locally continuous.
If $S' = S \circ \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is a small norm prime, then $|a(S') - a(S)|$ and $|b(S') - b(S)|$ are statistically likely to be small.

$$\implies |\Psi(S') - \Psi(S)| \text{ is small.}$$

This property allows the VAPO optimizer to "sense" that it is getting closer to a correct solution, enabling gradient-like descent on a discrete graph.

### 3.2 Semantic Adapter

Converts numerical sequences into ProofAction. This remains a deterministic mapping.

## 4. Security & Verifiability

### 4.1 Time Security (Hidden Path)

Security relies on the hardness of the Shortest Path Problem (or DLP) in the huge Cayley Graph of $Cl(\Delta)$. Finding the specific sequence of generators (the path) that connects $S_0$ to $S_{final}$ is computationally infeasible without the history.

### 4.2 Proof of Will

The Proof Bundle is the Path Record:

$$\text{Bundle} = \{ \text{ContextHash}, S_{final}, \text{Path} = [\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_k] \}$$

Verification involves replaying the walk on the graph:

$$S_0 \xrightarrow{\epsilon_1} S_1 \dots \xrightarrow{\epsilon_k} S_{final}$$

---

## 5. Conclusion

HTP is re-specified as:
* **Soul:** A node in the Class Group Cayley Graph.
* **Will:** An agent performing heuristic search on this graph utilizing the Lipschitz continuity of LCP.
* **Body:** The linear congruence projection of the node into logical space.

No imaginary manifolds, just rigorous discrete algebra.
