# HYPER-TENSOR PROTOCOL (HTP): Ideal Model Specification

"The Soul evolves, the Will optimizes, the Body manifests."

## Abstract

This document defines the **Hyper-Tensor Protocol (HTP)**. The protocol establishes an algebraic evolution mechanism based on the Ideal Class Group of Imaginary Quadratic Fields for the generation, verification, and materialization of logical paths.

**Core Transformation:**
The system transitions from a "continuous manifold approximation" to a rigorous **Discrete Algebraic Graph Search**. Truth is the zero-energy state found by traversing the Cayley Graph of the class group.

## 1. The Soul: Discrete Algebraic State Space

### 1.1 The Structure: Finite Abelian Group $Cl(\Delta)$

The core state space is not a continuous manifold, but a finite discrete Abelian group: the **Ideal Class Group** $Cl(\Delta)$.

* **Discriminant:** $\Delta < 0$ and $\Delta \equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$
* **Elements:** Equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms $[a, b, c]$.
* **Topology:** Discrete topology. No intrinsic notion of "infinitesimal" exists naturally.

### 1.2 The Geometry: Cayley Graph

To define "neighborhoods" and "search directions" for the Will, we explicitly construct a **Cayley Graph** $\mathcal{G}$.

* **Vertices:** Elements of $Cl(\Delta)$.
* **Generating Set ($\mathcal{P}$):** A selected set of prime ideal classes (perturbations) generated by the VAPO perturber.

$$\mathcal{P} = \{ [\mathfrak{p}_1], [\mathfrak{p}_1]^{-1}, \dots, [\mathfrak{p}_k], [\mathfrak{p}_k]^{-1} \}$$

* **Metric:** The distance $d(S_1, S_2)$ is defined as the **Word Metric** relative to $\mathcal{P}$ — the length of the shortest path between $S_1$ and $S_2$ on the graph.

### 1.3 State Evolution Dynamics (Decoupled)

To utilize geometric heuristics on a discrete graph, we explicitly decouple the Search Dynamics from the Materialization Dynamics.

#### Search Dynamics (The Will's Walk)
The Will operates on the static Cayley Graph.

$$S_{k+1} = S_k \circ \epsilon_k$$

* $S_k$: The current candidate seed.
* $\epsilon_k \in \mathcal{P}$: A perturbation.

#### Time Dynamics (The Observation)
Once a candidate seed $S$ is selected, it is "unfolded" in time to generate the logical path.

$$O_0 = S$$
$$O_{t+1} = O_t^2$$

## 2. The Will: Discrete Graph Search

### 2.1 The Optimization Objective

The responsibility of the Will is to navigate the Cayley Graph to find a node $S^*$ such that the projected logical path satisfies zero energy. 

To reconcile the discrete nature of logic with the need for search guidance, we use two maps:

1.  **Materialization Map ($\Pi$):** $Cl(\Delta) \to \text{ProofAction}^*$ (Discrete output)
2.  **Feature Map ($\Psi$):** $Cl(\Delta) \to \mathbb{R}^k$ (Continuous embedding)

**Optimization Goal:**

$$\text{Minimize } J(S) = E_{barrier}(\Pi(S)) + E_{residual}(\Psi(S))$$
$$\text{subject to } S \in V(\mathcal{G})$$

### 2.2 VAPO on Graphs

Since gradients $\nabla J$ are undefined on a discrete graph, **VAPO (Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization)** operates as a Heuristic Search.

**Assumption: Empirical Metric Smoothness**
We rely on the statistical assumption that small steps in the graph (small norm generators) result in bounded changes in the feature space $\Psi(S)$.

Let $\delta$ be the **Local Variation Bound**:
$$\delta = \max_{\epsilon \in \mathcal{P}_{small}} || \Psi(S) - \Psi(S \circ \epsilon) ||$$

We assume $\delta$ is small enough to allow for "Gradient Sense" in the residual term $E_{residual}$, despite the underlying algebraic chaos.

**Search Strategy:**
1.  **Expansion:** Generate neighbors $\mathcal{N}(S_t) = \{ S_t \circ \epsilon \mid \epsilon \in \mathcal{P} \}$
2.  **Evaluation:** Compute energy $J$ for all neighbors.
3.  **Selection:** Move to the neighbor with the lowest energy (Greedy Hill Climbing on the Graph).

## 3. The Body: Topological Materialization

### 3.1 The Feature Map $\Psi$ (Continuous)

We utilize **Canonical Modular Projection**, which maps the algebraic state to invariant geometric features ($\tau$-features).

**The Modular Point:**
For a reduced form $[a, b, c]$, the point in the Upper Half Plane $\mathbb{H}$ is:
$$\tau = \frac{-b + i\sqrt{|\Delta|}}{2a} = x + iy$$

**The Embedding $\Psi(S)$:**
$$\Psi(S) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(2\pi x) \\ \sin(2\pi x) \\ \log(y) \end{bmatrix}$$

> **Note:** Legacy Linear Congruence Projection (LCP) has been deprecated due to Reduction Chaos.

### 3.2 The Materialization Map $\Pi$ (Discrete)

Converts the algebraic orbit into `ProofAction` sequences. This is a deterministic mapping from the algebraic state to the logical domain.

$$\Pi(S) = \text{Adapter}(\text{Orbit}(S))$$

## 4. Security & Verifiability

### 4.1 Time Security (Hidden Path)
Security relies on the hardness of the Shortest Path Problem (or DLP) in the huge Cayley Graph of $Cl(\Delta)$.

### 4.2 Proof of Will
The Proof Bundle is the Path Record:
$$\text{Bundle} = \{ \text{ContextHash}, S_{final}, \text{Path} = [\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_k] \}$$

---

## 5. Conclusion

HTP is re-specified as:
* **Soul:** A node in the Class Group Cayley Graph ($S$).
* **Will:** An agent performing heuristic search guided by the Feature Map $\Psi$ under empirical smoothness assumptions.
* **Body:** The Materialization $\Pi$ of the node into logical space.

No imaginary guarantees, just rigorous discrete algebra guided by statistical geometry.
